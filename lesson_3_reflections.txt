When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For backup reasons, or when multiple people work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you could pull changes made by other participants while you don't want this.
you want to stay in controll of the commits.
